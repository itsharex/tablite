## Installation

You can download [Windows and Mac desktop app here](https://github.com/tmg0/tablite/releases)

For MacOS user with M1 or later, you need to execute the following command in terminal to allow the application downloaded form the internet:

```
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Tablite.app
```

Or use the `x64` version in release page to bypass this issue.

## Usage

### Tables

- Fuzzy search for table names
- Dynamically filter tables with popover selectors
- Double-click a cell to enter edit mode
- Select rows for deletion
- Disvard changes or preview the actual SQL before saving
- Support re-editing SQL before saving

### Queries

- Fuzzy search for table names
- Automatically generate an SQL query from the title as a prompt
- `âŒ˜` + `s` or click the `Save` button for saving
- Run the query and display the time costs

### Settings

- Select ai assistant based model
- Enter api keys for different providers

## Developing

```
pnpm install && pnpm tauri dev
```

### Comparisons

- Tauri: Small bundle size and low memory usage, dependence by user os, may have rendering differences across different systems/platforms due to WebKit version.

- Electron: Large bundle size and large mem usage, has high consistency in cross-platform application rendering.

### Code Design

![Design](./docs/CodeDesign.png)

#### [`app`](./app)

WebView client application with official nuxt design (future.compatibilityVersion: 4), read [Directory Structure](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/app).

#### [`app.composables`](./app/composables)

Reacitve vue hooks

#### [`src-tauri`](./src-tauri)

Tauri service root directory

#### [`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`](./src-tauri/src/lib.rs)

App instance entry, plugin register center (includes: sql-extra / log / store)

#### [`src-tauri/crates/tauri-plugin-sql-extra`](./src-tauri/crates/tauri-plugin-sql-extra)

Custom tauri plugin sql implement.

Heavily inspired by [tauri-plugin-sql](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-sql) and extends its capabilities by adding support for multiple database types.

### Agents

#### [`Text to SQL`](./app/composables/useText2Sql.ts)

Generate executable sql query with natural language.

- Analysis relevant table names by model function calling
- Provide table schema with row index
- Generate prompt by preset templates
- Generate SQL query
- Format results and response with sse

## Roadmap

Ranking here very subjective and based on personal pain points.

### SQL Client

- Support create table by GUI
- Support create connection by a form instead of a connection string
- Support edit or create columns / index by GUI
- Support export table filter results to csv
- Collect SQL execute histories
- Better code auto completion

### AI Assistant

- Support table visualization dashboard generation
- Support custom table context
- Support inline assistant in code editor
- Support MCP service
