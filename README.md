## Installation

You can download [Windows and Mac desktop app here](https://github.com/tmg0/tablite/releases)

For MacOS user with M1 or later, you need to execute the following command in terminal to allow the application downloaded form the internet:

```
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Tablite.app
```

Or use the `x64` version in release page to bypass this issue.

## Development

```
pnpm install && pnpm tauri dev
```

## Roadmap

Ranking here very subjective and based on personal pain points.

### Milestone 1 - `table structure`

- Create or delete table

### Milestone 2 - `form create connection`

Support create connection by a form instead of a connection string

- MySQL
- SQLite
- Postgres

### Milestone 3 - `chat with tables`
